## Week 1 (April 21st - April 27th)

| Date | Hans | Joey | Volker | Wing | Task |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| April 23rd | | | 2 | | Lecture preparation (github video) |
| April 24th | 2 | 2 | 2 | 2 | Attending classes |
| April 24th | 3 | 3 | 3 | 3 | Choosing a project (all, 3h pp) Leiningen - no tools for clojure  - Gephi - no tests - Neo4j it is then |
| April 24th | 4 | 4 | 4 | 4 | Building Neo4j (all, 4h pp) After cloning `$ mvn clean build [-DrunITs]` Integration testing fails with one test. This step was also part of choosing the project. |
| April 24th |   |   | 2 |   | Building Gephi Gephi can be build, but the lack of tests makes it hard to know if it really was successful. |
| April 25th |   |   |   |   | Integrating in Eclipse. See `community/cypher/README.txt` for needed plugins and workflow. After carefully following the readme, project is buildable in Eclipse. The problem was Scala sources not being recognized without the Eclipse-Scala plugin. |
| April 26th | 2 | 2 | 2 | 2 | Attending classes |
| April 27th |   |   | 1 |   | Learning to work with safaribooksonline using a VPN. Too bad we can only read online on the VPN or campus network. That kind of excludes reading on my mobile phone. |
| April 27th |   |   | 1 |   | Collecting bookmarks for the stakeholder analysis. I collected bookmarks from the [Neo4j website](http://neo4j.org) and documentation and the [Neo Technology](http://neotechnology.com) website. After I analyze it some more, my findings and the bookmarks will be on our [repository's wiki](https://github.com/delftswa/neo4j/wiki/Stakeholder-Analysis-WIP). |
