Dear Prof. Alex Iosup and Prof. Dick Epema,

Attached to this email is our report for the large lab exercise for the course IN4392 Cloud Computing. We apologise for the delay of the submission but due to constrained schedule with exams and other project work, we were not able to complete on time.

The project including the report and datasets from the experiments are publicly available at https://github.com/jhejderup/Awsseract. 


Best Regards
Wing Lung Ngai
on behalf of Group 1
